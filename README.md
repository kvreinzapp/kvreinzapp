## üëã About Me

I'm a passionate programmer with a strong drive for creating valuable solutions that benefit people. My diverse experience spans from hardware to software, backend to frontend, giving me a solid foundation in programming and the ability to learn new technologies quickly.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Telecommunication Engineering from Tiangong University in Tianjin, where I studied both hardware and software for IoT and smart home technology. I later pursued my passion for programming with a Master's degree at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University in Suzhou.

Currently, I'm working as an intern at Bosch China, where I participate in the entire software development lifecycle of various projects, collaborating with colleagues from different countries. I especially enjoy multicultural environments where everyone contributes toward common, valuable goals.
